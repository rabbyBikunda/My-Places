Mobile application built for android using Android Studio. It makes use of the Google Maps API to get locations of hotels in Dublin.
Markers which incorporate info windows are placed at the selected sites. When markers are clicked details are provided about the hotel in a new activity.Each hotel has a ground overlay of the image of the hotel. The app also incorporates a polyline to represent the distance between hotels. In addition there is a GeoJSON layer to the map that identifies hotels that are 4 and a half star, provide free breakfast and allows pets.
